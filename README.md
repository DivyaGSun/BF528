# BF528
BF528 Final Project

## Files
### Project 2 <br>
`programmer_qsubs` - Using Tophat, reads from postnatal day 0 (P0) are aligned to the mouse genome reference called mm9 to generate an accepted_hits.bam file. This file is further evaluated for flag-based mapping quality using Sam-tools. Comprehensive evaluation and quality checks are further undertaken with the RSeQC QA package. Gene expression is quantified with Cufflinks and the Cuffdiff utility.

### Project 5 <br>
`analyst.R` - The cell subpopulations are classified into distinct cell types, using the marker genes provided in the Supplementary Data of Baron et al.. Marker genes for each of these cell types are retained, with a list of novel marker genes exported for further analysis.
